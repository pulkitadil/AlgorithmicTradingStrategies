# Algorithmic Trading Strategies

- This repo contains a report of the reading I did on various trading strategies like market-making, hedging, mean reversion and momentum-based
strategies involving moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), arbitrage strategies, and pairs trading.
- The repo also includes programs for backtesting of some simple strategies using ```backtesting``` library in python.
